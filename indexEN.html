    <meta name="description" content="Welcome on my CV as a freelancer.I offer you my services in web development, marketing and data analysis ! But why so much diversity ? After my Master degree in marketing I have worked for more than 3 years as an Quality adviser. With this job I had at the same time some missions in marketing, data and emailing. That explains my knowledge in marketing and in data analysis. But I was not fully myself with this job, so I took a distance learning to become a web developper. And that explains my knowledge in web development.">

For some personal reasons I followed my fianc√© and today I live in Senegal where I started my knew professional life!</p>
